## Hookit-app
- Is a golf app to let users enter their golf information.
- start the application by running "python3 app/menu.py".
- It has different functions, a few works other is still on the schedule.
    - Create a user - check
    - Login - check
    - See other users - check
    - Find specific user by name - check
    - Create a post for all to read - check
    - Delete post - check
    - Send a message to another user - Not check

All functions run on a tkinter GUI, it works but could perhaps look nicer.

## Dockerfile
- Dockerfile is ok, "docker build" runs and build an image.
- "Docker run" wont work, it says it misses som environment variable, "display". I haven't figured it out yet.
- Docker build and push in the pipeline is stuck due to an authentication problem. It should work, but still working to 
    make a few things work together.
